# Java Dataformat UA NodeSet

## Important Remarks regarding I4AAS NodeSet

The OPC UA Companion Specification as published by [opcfoundation.org](https://opcfoundation.org/developer-tools/specifications-opc-ua-information-models/opc-ua-for-i4-asset-administration-shell/) currently targets AAS Version 2. Since the core model is build on Version 3, an **unofficial pre-release version I4AAS V3** is used.

You can find the pre-release UA NodeSet as xml under /nodeset/i4aas as well as all changes documented in a CSV file.

## generated JAXB classes

The UA NodeSet de/serializer is based on JAXB annotated classes, generated by from 3 XSD files (/nodeset/xsd), which you can also extract from the pom.xml. The execution with id *generate-uatypes-classes* is deactivated since minor manual changes were necessary so that the XML namespaces are set correctly. To prevent overrides, these generated, then adjusted classes for *generate-uatypes-classes* are copy-pasted from /target/generated/src/main/java to /src/main/java If you need to update these classes, consider to change the execution phase to *generate-sources*.
